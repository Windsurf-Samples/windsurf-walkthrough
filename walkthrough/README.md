# Windsurf Editor Modalities

> **Note**: This walkthrough is intended for the Windsurf Editor. If you are using the Windsurf Plugins/Extensions, your Windsurf Tab and Cascade experience may vary.

Windsurf provides three primary modalities for AI-assisted development. First time in Windsurf? Explore the modalities below for hands-on examples and real user flows. 

For full documentation on Windsurf modalities, see the [Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started)

## 1. [Windsurf Cascade](./cascade.md)

Explore Cascade to experience Windsurf's collaborative, agentic experience. 
### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Cascade can help you:
- Plan and execute complex programming tasks with ease
- Turn multi-step workflows into simple, customizable prompts
- Effortlessly pull context from across your workspace right when you need it


## 2. [Windsurf Command](./command.md)

Explore Command to experience a fast, inline AI-powered code assistant.
### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Command can help you:
- Instantly edit and refactor code directly in the editor
- Generate proper CLI syntax in the terminal using natural language


## 3. [Windsurf Tab](./windsurf-tab.md)

Explore Tab to accelerate your coding with intelligent, context-aware autocompletions.
### Key Takeaways:
In this walkthrough, you’ll see how Tab can help you:
- Accept completions and automate repetitive code patterns with a single keystroke
- Effortlessly jump between code sections using next-intent prediction
- Generate suggestions before, after, and between lines of code


## Getting Started

1. **Cascade**: Open the Cascade chat window and start describing your task
2. **Command**: Use `Command + I` or click the "Edit" button that appears when selecting code
3. **Tab**: Look for tab indicators while coding and press `Tab` to accept suggestions

For guided examples and workflows, check the individual modality files:
- [`cascade.md`](./cascade.md)
- [`command.md`](./command.md)
- [`windsurf-tab.md`](./windsurf-tab.md)
