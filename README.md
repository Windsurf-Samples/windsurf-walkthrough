# Windsurf Walkthrough

Welcome to the Windsurf Walkthrough! This project includes a sample code base and suggested flows (prompts + user actions) as you get hands-on with the Windsurf Editor.

Instead of providing an exhaustive demonstration of all Windsurf's capabilities as your AI coding assistant, this project focuses on a few representative user flows and key takeaways for working with Windsurf.

For the latest information on Windsurf, check out [Windsurf University](https://windsurf.com/university) and the [Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/getting-started)
