# Windsurf Walkthrough

Welcome to the Windsurf Walkthrough repository! This project is designed to help you learn how to effectively collaborate with Windsurf, an advanced AI coding assistant. Using a general-purpose contact form application as our example codebase, you'll explore various ways to interact with and leverage Windsurf's capabilities.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an interactive tutorial for working with Windsurf's collaborative AI assistant. While the codebase implements a contact form application, its primary purpose is to demonstrate different interaction patterns and features available in the Windsurf editor.

## Repository Structure

```
./
├── contact-form-app/     # Example codebase (React + Python)
└── script/              # Introductory step-by-step Windsurf tutorials
    └── workshop/    # Advanced self-paced workshop following introductory tutorials
```

## Getting Started

The walkthroughs in `script/` will guide you through various Windsurf features and demonstrate how to:
- Collaborate effectively with an AI coding assistant
- Navigate and understand existing codebases
- Make targeted code improvements
- Work with different interaction modalities

## Walkthrough Instructions

### Step 1: Introductory Tutorials

Begin by following the guides in `script/[modality].md` to explore different ways of working with Windsurf. Each walkthrough is designed to showcase specific features and interaction patterns. It is recommended you open these files in Github instead of your IDE for readability

### Step 2: Advanced Workshop

After completing the introductory tutorials, proceed to the advanced workshop in `script/workshop/README.md`. This self-paced workshop provides open-ended challenges that encourage you to experiment with different approaches and combinations of Windsurf's capabilities.

The advanced workshop will help you:
- Apply what you've learned in practical scenarios
- Discover effective combinations of Windsurf modalities
- Develop your own workflow preferences
- Tackle more complex development tasks

Note: Due to the probabilistic nature of AI interactions, your specific experience may vary while maintaining the core learning objectives.
