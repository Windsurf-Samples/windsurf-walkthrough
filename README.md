# Windsurf Walkthrough

Welcome to the Windsurf Walkthrough repository! This project is designed to help you learn how to effectively collaborate with Windsurf, an advanced AI coding assistant. Using a general-purpose contact form application as our example codebase, you'll explore various ways to interact with and leverage Windsurf's capabilities.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an interactive tutorial for working with Windsurf's collaborative AI assistant. While the codebase implements a contact form application, its primary purpose is to demonstrate different interaction patterns and features available in the Windsurf editor.

## Repository Structure

```
./
├── contact-form-app/     # Example codebase (React + Python)
└── script/              # Windsurf interaction tutorials
    └── by-[x]/    # Alternative use-case-specific walkthroughs
```

## Getting Started

The walkthroughs in `script/` will guide you through various Windsurf features and demonstrate how to:
- Collaborate effectively with an AI coding assistant
- Navigate and understand existing codebases
- Make targeted code improvements
- Work with different interaction modalities

## Walkthrough Instructions

Follow the guides in `script/[modality].md` to explore different ways of working with Windsurf. Each walkthrough is designed to showcase specific features and interaction patterns.

Note: Due to the probabilistic nature of AI interactions, your specific experience may vary while maintaining the core learning objectives.
