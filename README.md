### Option 1: Introductory Tutorials

Begin by following the guides in [guides](/guides) to explore different ways of working with Windsurf. While these files will be cloned to your local machine, it is recommended you open these files in Github for readability.

### Option 2: Advanced Workshop

Once you understand the core capabilities of Windsurf, you may proceed to the [Advanced Workshop](guides/workshop/README.md). This self-guided section presents open-ended challenges designed to help you explore and combine Windsurf's features in practical scenarios.

The advanced workshop will help you:
- Apply what you've learned in practical scenarios
- Discover effective combinations of Windsurf modalities
- Develop your own workflow preferences
- Tackle more complex development tasks

Note: While your specific interactions with Windsurf may vary, you should still gain an understanding of the core learning objectives to see how Windsurf can help you in your development workflow.
