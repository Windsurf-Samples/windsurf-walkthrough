### Extensions

You can access the `Extensions` tab by clicking the icons on the left sidebar in the editor or hitting `Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + X`. You can install extensions to add new features and functionality to the editor.

#### Linters

Linters are tools that analyze code and report on potential errors, style violations, and other issues. You can install linters via the `Extensions` tab on the left side of the editor.

This project has a mix of TypeScript and Python files, so we'll install a linter for both. Search for `ESLint` and install the one shown below. Then search for `Pylint` and install the one shown below.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img src="../assets/editor/editor-eslint.png" alt="ESLint" />
    <img src="../assets/editor/editor-pylint.png" alt="Pylint" />
</div>

ESLint and Pylint have already been configured in this project, so you can run `npm run eslint` in the `frontend` directory or open a Python file to see linting errors and warnings.

#### Code Formatters

Code formatters are tools that automatically format code to a consistent style. You can install code formatters via the `Extensions` tab on the left side of the editor.

Search for `Prettier` and install the one shown below.

![Prettier](../assets/editor/editor-prettier.png)

To run Prettier, you can hit `Shift + Alt/Option + F` to format a file. You can also configure the code formatter to run on save. To do so, hit `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for `Open User Settings`. Select the non-JSON option and then search for `Format on Save` in the search box. Check the box next to this setting. Then, search for `default formatter` in the search box and select `Prettier - Code formatter`.

### Source Control

The editor has integrated source control management (SCM) and includes Git support out-of-the-box. Many other source control providers are available through the Extensions Marketplace. You can access the `Source Control` tab by clicking the icons on the left sidebar in the editor or hitting `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + G`.

![Source Control](../assets/editor/editor-source-control-tab.png)

#### Generate Commit Messages

In Windsurf, you can generate commit messages by clicking the `Generate` button in the Source Control tab. This will generate a commit message based on the changes (staged and unstaged) in the repository.

![Generate Commit Messages](../assets/editor/editor-generate-commit-msgs.png)

Alternatively, you can set up a workflow to use [GitHub's MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server), stage all changes, create the commit message and description, and commit it.

---

### Command Palette

The Command Palette is a powerful tool that allows you to run commands and access features in the editor. You can open the Command Palette by hitting `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`.

![Command Palette](../assets/editor/editor-command-palette.png)

#### Common Commands

##### Reload Window

If something does not mount correctly in the editor, you can reload the window by hitting `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to bring up the Command Palette and searching for `Reload Window`. Alternatively, you can hit `Cmd/Ctrl + R` to reload the window.

---

### Bottom Panel

The bottom panel is a powerful tool that allows you to run commands and access various features in the editor. You can open/close the bottom panel by hitting `Cmd/Ctrl + J`.

![Bottom Panel](../assets/editor/editor-bottom-panel.png)

#### Problems

Displays errors and warnings in your code from linters, compilers, and other tools. Clicking an item takes you to the source line.

#### Output

Shows output from various VS Code processes and extensions (e.g., Git, build tools, extensions).

#### Debug Console

Lets you interact with your running application during debugging, view variable output, and evaluate expressions.

#### Terminal

Provides a built-in command-line terminal for running scripts, commands, and version control directly within the editor.

#### Ports

Lists forwarded ports when working with remote development environments, containers, or cloud workspaces.

---

### Common IDE Tasks

#### Searching for Code

##### Native Search

You can search through files by hitting `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F` and typing your search query. This will perform a regex search through the files in your workspace.

##### Cascade Enhancements

- Once you've searched for code, you can drag the search results into the Cascade panel to make edits or ask questions about the code.
- Alternatively, you can use Cascade to semantically search for code/functionality in your codebase.

#### Git Workflows

##### Native Approach

You can use the built-in Git features in the Source Control tab in the editor to manage your changes with your repository.

##### Cascade Enhancements

You can use Workflows to accelerate your Git workflows. Here are some example Workflows:

**Stage and Commit Changes**
```markdown
## Workflow: Stage and Commit Changes

**Trigger:** When developer requests to commit via prompt or context menu

**Steps:**
1. Scan the working directory for unstaged and staged files.
2. If no files are staged, prompt:  
   "_No files are staged. Would you like me to stage all modified files?_"
3. Once files are staged, summarize the changes:
   - Group by file
   - Highlight what each change accomplishes
4. Generate a commit message using a conventional format (e.g. Conventional Commits).
   - Example: `feat(user-profile): add avatar upload logic`
5. Confirm with the developer:
   - "_Use this commit message? [Y/n]_"
6. Execute:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "<generated-message>"
```

---

**Create Pull Requests**
```markdown
## Workflow: Create Pull Request

**Trigger:** Developer pushes a feature branch and requests a PR

**Steps:**
1. Detect current branch and its target base (default to `develop` or `main`).
2. Summarize all changes between source and target branch:
   - Key features added, bugs fixed, files changed
3. Auto-generate:
   - PR title: based on branch name or major change
   - PR body: bulleted summary of features, testing notes, and related issues
4. Prompt for reviewer tags or labels (e.g., `review`, `needs-docs`)
5. Execute API call to GitHub/GitLab to open PR.
6. Confirm with a link to the PR:  
   "_Pull request created: [link]_"
```

---

**Merge Branches**
```markdown
## Workflow: Merge Branches

**Trigger:** Developer initiates merge request in IDE

**Steps:**
1. Confirm target and source branch:
   - "_Merge `feature/x` into `develop`?_"
2. Fetch and rebase `feature/x` against `develop` (if rebase strategy is preferred).
3. Check for conflicts:
   - If none, perform a fast-forward or merge.
   - If conflicts exist, switch to conflict resolution workflow.
4. Confirm with the user:
   - "_Proceed with merge and delete source branch?_"
5. Finalize with:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/x
   git branch -d feature/x
```

---

**Generate Changelogs**
```markdown
## Workflow: Generate Changelogs

**Trigger:** Developer prepares a release or requests changelog generation

**Steps:**
1. Determine the commit range (e.g., last tag to HEAD, or last N PRs).
2. Parse commit messages using Conventional Commits or PR titles.
3. Categorize entries:
   - `Features`, `Fixes`, `Chores`, `Docs`, etc.
4. Format the changelog in Markdown:
   ```markdown
   ## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-20
   ### Added
   - Add support for dark mode in settings panel

   ### Fixed
   - Resolve crash when syncing large files

   ### Chores
   - Upgrade dependency: Axios 1.2.4 → 1.3.0
   ```

### Run and Debug

The editor has a `Run and Debug` tab that allows you to run and debug code. You can access the `Run and Debug` tab by clicking the icon in the left sidebar of the editor or hitting `Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + D`.
