# Windsurf Cascade 

Windsurf Cascade is a Collaborative, Agentic AI-assistant and is the natural evolution of a Chat Assistant. Cascade has access to research your code base, invoke tools to edit your code and run terminal commands, and understand your recent actions (your current trajectory) to derive your next intent.

**Note:** Cascade is highly flexible as an Agentic System. This demo will walk through some of Cascade's core capabilities, but will be nonexhaustive.
